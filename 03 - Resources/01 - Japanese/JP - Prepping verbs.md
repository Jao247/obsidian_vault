# JP - Prepping verbs

## Ichidan　{一段動詞|いち|だん|どう|し}
Verbs with only a single conjugation - These are verbs that end in iru/eru (いる／える)
Example of Ichidan verbs:
* To eat | 食べる
* To See | 見る
* To wake up | 起きる
* To open | 開ける

Conjugation of Ichidan verbs is done by removing the る at the end of the dictionary form and adding an ending. This will turn the verb into it's verb-stem which can be altered to fit with the required ending:
* 食べ
* 見
* 起き
* 開け

An alternative name for these verbs are "る-verbs" as they all end with the る hiragana character.

## Godan　{五段動詞|ご|だん|どう|し}
Verbs with 5 (五) conjugations - These verbs end with a hiragana from the u-row (す、つ、む、く, etc.)
Example of Godan verbs:
* To read | 読む
* To write | 書く
* To speak | 話す
* To listen | 聞く 
* To understand | 分かる

Though some of the Godan verbs can end with る they are typically not ending in an eru or iru sound. The test of a る-verb for if it is Godan or Ichidan is to try conjugating it as an Ichidan - If this doesn't sound right then it is a Godan verb.

Conjugation of Godan verbs is done be moving the final u-row to another vowel row. Each of these vowel rows have a specific purpose;
* a-row: negative(ない) or would like(なきゅ)
* i-row: 
	* polite, positive (ます) negative (ません)
	* Can also be used for wanting to do (たい)
* u-row: dictionary form, used in informal contexts
* e-row: aggressive, commanding, seen as rude.
* o-row: Let's --------, typically followed by a う when written.
* [[09-12-24 1441 て-form|て-form]]: indicated with a て after the verb stem - a request / order in a more polite form.

Now there are "six" conjugations written above, but the u-row endings are not considered a conjugation as there are the Dictionary Form. This allows the te-form to be included in the list.

## Irregular verbs {不規則動詞|ふ|き|そく|どう|し}
Thankfully for Japanese there are only two irregular verbs, and they are easy enough to remember. These are: 
* To do | する (suru)
* To come | 来る (kuru)
