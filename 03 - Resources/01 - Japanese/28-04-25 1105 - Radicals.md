# What is a Radical?
In Japanese a radical is the {部首|ぶしゅ} (root) of the Kanji. It imparts it’s meaning onto the Kanji. The radical can be in different locations in the Kanji, And in a dictionary the radical is the method by which the Kanji are ordered.

## Some examples:
All of the below examples feature the 寺 kanji on the right side, however the meaning is derived from the radical on the left.
- 時: The radical of this kanji is 日 (sun, day, time). The meaning of this kanji is “time”
- 詩: The radical of this kanji is 言 (words, to speak, say). The meaning of this kanji is “poetry, poem”.
- 待: The radical of this kanji is 扌(hand). The meaning of this kanji is “to hold”.

# Radicals
There are no official names for the radicals, and although there are 214 radicals not all of them are in use in modern Japanese. Radicals are categorised into seven main groups based on the position of the radical in the Kanji. Some radicals are kanji in and of themselves. (such as: 大, 日, 月). In such cases, the kanji and the radical are one and the same, and thus the position of the radical in the kanji is irrelevant.
