# Animation Hit Detection

This method of Hit box creation uses animation montage to create a Hitbox using selected sockets on the character mesh - This will be used for attacks mostly.

Though this also outlines how the Anim Notify State system works - Create an Anim Notify State BP then you can use that as you wish.

Can be used to trigger the visibility / collide-ability of an attack.
