### Journal
#### 15:06
Well… I have not been keeping up with this. Things were a little too hectic in Nagoya to be able to record in this properly. And it has also been slipping my mind to actually go back and reflect on this. Some things have happened fast, others have been slow. And they have really taken their time.

Life kinda kicked me down for a bit. I have reached Kyoto and I am really taking it slow here. In that I have only been going out after mid day even then I have not done much. Today I did go to the Kyoto imperial palace. Which is something I guess. でも it still isn't too far from where I am staying so the journey was not too long either.

I spent some time yesterday going to Uniqlo and GU two clothes shops that are extremely common here. Only to find that the clothes stocked there did not actually fit me. And that If I wanted to get new pairs of jeans I would need to order online and collect in store… which would probably be easier to do on my laptop.
