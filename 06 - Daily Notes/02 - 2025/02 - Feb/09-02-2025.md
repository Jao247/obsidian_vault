### Journal
#### 08:30
Got out of bed a bit earlier today to say goodbye to Gabrielle (22F), a French woman who was staying at the hostel and was a character that made the hostel common room an interesting space. Herself, Felix (18M German) and Lana (18F, German) all went to Nikko a small nature park up north of Tokyo.

#### 12:37
Now after returning to the hostel I am sitting and spending some time in the common area, though just doing stuff on the laptop, such as writing this journal and the one for yesterday.
I used the opportunity of travelling around today to test out the SUICA card that I have. The cost of going to akihabara was 148 JPY.

After having a look around there is a place I spotted on the map that I will want to go to, However I think I will leave it until tomorrow to go and visit at this point. It is the Japanese Sword Museum, Just over the river so a quick walk or a quick train hop over. on the Chiba-sobu line.

I have to make another attempt to get a green SUICA card, Especailly since Sam (?M, America) has managed to get one.
