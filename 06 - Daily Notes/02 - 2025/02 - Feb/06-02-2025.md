### Journal
#### 08:52
It is the first morning in Tokyo, and I am sitting writing this on the laptop as my Phone needs some time to charge. Although I was initially worried about my snoring it seems that worry was not needed, as there are other people in the bunks around me that are also snorers. Now all I need to worry about is getting a decent nights sleep. Maybe that will be achieved by using headphones and watching some videos before passing out, but who knows how well that will work until it is tested.

There is a train line that passes by this building, and although I am at the opposite side of the building from the train, it can still be quite loud. There is a gap of 4 hours from midnight to 4am where the trains do not run. But that alone would not facilitate good sleep. I have not tried to figure out the timing between trains as right now that does not seem very relevant. 

What I need to do now is wait for my phone to charge some more then head to a nearby kombini for breakfast, and to pick up some other goods.
