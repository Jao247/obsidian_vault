# DAILY NOTE

### Journal
#### Postmortem of the day
Although nothing has been written on the day off for today, there was a trip made to うえのこえん Ueno Park… The kanji for which still eludes me as I am unsure how to write it. I have seen it when doing the Duolingo lessons but damn it if I can’t remember what they are… I also saw them today (9th) but did not pay attention to them.

The main purpose of the visit was to get the Welcome Suica card from Ueno 駅 it was a bit of a process walking through the station to find it. Then we took a brief break and travelled to the national museum at the north eastern corner of the park.
