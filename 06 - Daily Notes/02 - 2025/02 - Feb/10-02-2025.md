# DAILY NOTE
Monday, February 10th, 2025
***
### Journal
#### 07:30
An early morning today, 2 more people I met in the hostel gone further along on their trip, though Felix hasn’t left yet

Plan for the day is to go to the Japanese Sword Museum, and explore a bit around Ryogoku. the other side of the river from the Hostel. It’s a single train stop or a quick walk around to get to the other side. I don’t know which method I will use.

Plan for tomorrow involves a trip over to Tokyo Tower (essentially) as it is nearby to TokyoLab - Borderless, I have booked tickets for it as a precaution since it just makes lives easier. 

#### 07:50
I think I am gonna chill and play some Factorio? - maybe.

#### 10:30
Played a bit of Factorio, gonna go get food and then look at going to the Sword Museum
