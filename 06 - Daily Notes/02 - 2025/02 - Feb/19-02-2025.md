# DAILY NOTE
Wednesday, February 19th, 2025

### Journal
#### 15:15
Well shit, nearly been a week since I last actually wrote in the daily notes here. I am not really going to be able to recap all of that. One, that is too much work and two… I really don’t think anything too memorable actually came up over the last week. Maybe the day trip to Yokohama that I took, but I think that is really it. There wasn’t really much else that I did… It’s funny to think that I am in japan on a holiday and yet I have spent the last three days now, chilling at the hostel and resting. There are things I should be going to do, and I do really mean that in terms of objectives that need to be accomplished. But realistically I have time to organise this stuff so it isn’t too major of a rush.

Yesterday I finally got around to doing the laundry that I have been needing to do. Aside from that It was a relatively peaceful day. There is another talkative bunch that has made their appearance here now which I do appreciate because it is nice to have people to discuss with. Of all people I have met one has actually managed to pick up on an accent that I very barely have. So it is interesting to have that occur. I don’t know how much I will be hanging out with them but I guess at this point it will be a “let it play out and see how it goes.”
