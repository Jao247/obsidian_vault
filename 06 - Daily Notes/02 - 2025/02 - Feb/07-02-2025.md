# DAILY NOTE

### Journal
#### 08:44
Morning, although it’s the third day it sure as hell doesn’t feel like it, feels like I have been here for a few weeks already. the feeling of the cold at the back of my throat and the sniffly nose do unfortunately remind me of the cold or flu that I have right now. Though in reality it isn’t too bad this morning.

When it comes to Japanese, it is still a WIP, as I had said to others last night before calling it a day, I have plenty of practice reading, and a small amount of practice speaking. That is the current limiting factor as it can be hard to get used to speaking it when you haven’t done so already. Though the few cashiers and so on that have heard me saying ありがとうございます The reaction has been positive, although brief. If anything I would believe that to be the most expected and basic courtesy for a traveller coming to Japan. Though I know some people show more restraint when it comes to learning languages, I feel as though I have managed to do a decent job at it so far.

I have more practice that needs to be done today. It does feel odd the be sitting in Japan and still practicing Japanese on a daily basis. でも昇進者です
