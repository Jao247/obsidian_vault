# DAILY NOTE

### Journal
#### 21:05
This day feels like it was a bust. Sleep was quite bad, due to a handful of different elements. Least of all the other loud mouths in the area and some people who decided that midnight was the best time to re-organise their bags. After waking at like 3 or 4 am it was struggle. I ended up getting out and coming downstairs just after 8am, Spent some time playing Factorio before the Laptop started to die. At which point I was trying to figure out what to do with myself. I had a few options of different locations to go. Both Shibuya and Shinjuku, being on the list.

Eventually decided on going to Shibuya, though maybe Shinjuku would have been easier? I got caught in Yotsuya station due to a breakdown of one of the trains. Along with that there was strong winds today which was causing a whole lot of delays on trains. It also made walking around the city disappointing and cold.

Only ended up staying maybe an hour or two, even then I didnâ€™t end up buying anything from any of the stores that I visited. The life of the hostel definitely seems to have died down now with Islam, Darren both gone, and with Sam gone on his work trips. The loudest voices are gone.
