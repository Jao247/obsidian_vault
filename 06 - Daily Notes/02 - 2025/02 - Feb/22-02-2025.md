# DAILY NOTE

### Journal
#### 18:30
Spent the day at Meiji Jingu near to Harajuku. It is a very beautiful shrine in the middle of a wooded area. Although most likely the trees were planted after or during the construction of the shrine. I say this as it seems to be the more likely idea than the trees being cut down around the location to create the specific pathways and so on. I could be wrong but it still created a beautiful and calm atmosphere.

With regards to the rest of this day… I don’t know where it will go but It will be good to see. There were mentions of a group of us going to get food / drinks then chilling in the lobby of the hostel but we will see if those plans continue.
