# DAILY NOTE
Friday, February 21st, 2025
***
### Journal
#### 12:20
Not too much of note has really happened over the last few days. I have met some of the new people staying in the hostel for the next few days, they seem like fun people to hang around with.

Yesterday was my birthday, I am now 29 Years old, and damn it does not feel like much has really changed. Hell my back is pretty fucked up but that is my own fault from the last year of sitting in awkward positions keeping my back with a specific amount of tension and then not being able to relieve that tension. at least not properly. So now I am faced with the dilemma about my back muscles being pretty screwed. I need to go and get a message, but I am unsure where to go for it.
