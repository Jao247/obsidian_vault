### Journal
#### 10:10 (🇯🇵)
And so, my journey to Japan has begun. I am still on the flight over, though it is quite the flight. I have managed to end up in a row all by myself,  with the row infront of me and the row behind me also having but a single occupant. This allows me to rest and relax as much as I want. I even moved over a seat so that i could sit without arm-rests getting in the way.

At the moment I am watching “Kingdom of the planet of the apes” Yet another in the Planet of the Apes series. Another which I have not truly being keeping up with. I am unsure If I missed an entry or if this makes me all caught up.

Other movies I have on the list aside from Venom, are repeats of movies I have already seen. Which will be nice to rewatch at somepoint but not necessary for now. The flight ran into some pretty bad turbulence as we started to fly over india, though now much of it has passed.

The true time for #japantrip2025 is now!
