### Journal
#### Postmortem
Uhh… I am writing this on the 13th I realised I am drawing a blank on what exactly I did this day. I went back to Ryogoku after my failed attempt from Monday, I went back to go and visit the Sword Museum, this time with success. On the way there I realised that the Sumo Ring actually featured a small free museum showcasing some of the successes of the Sumo Wrestlers and the things they have achieved.

The sword museum itself was actually a very interesting find, my sadness however was finding out that photos could not be taken of the pieces inside the museum. It also appeared that the majority of the building was offices for some purpose and that the museum location was a single room. I picked up some food at Ryogoku station just because it was handier, the food was good, Will stop by If I am in the area again.

When getting back to the hostel, I realised the extent of my bodies neediness to sleep, I hadn’t gotten much the night before due to the “incident” with Kevin.

Julia left early this morning and I feel like I should have done more to console her, But I am also wondering if she just wanted to forget it all happened. She was sweet, she deserved a better final night.
