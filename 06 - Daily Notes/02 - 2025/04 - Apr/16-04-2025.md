### Journal
#### 16:49
A return to Tokyo… Although that actually happened two days ago. Now I have seen most of the people that I met the first time that had made a return to Tokyo. One of those is Islam and Darren. Though Islam is now gone again. Darren is still around for a while longer.

With regards to staff at A16, there is of course the missing Sakurako-san and Yuyuko-san, they finished working here in the time that I was travelling Japan. A shame, they were both entertaining and fun to be around. There is a new girl who is working part time, Yuna-san, I haven’t had much time to chat with her yet but she seems like a fun person to hang out with. It will be nice to get to know her a bit before I leave.
