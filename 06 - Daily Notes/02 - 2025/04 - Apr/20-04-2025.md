# DAILY NOTE
Sunday, April 20th, 2025

### Journal
#### 20:45
I sit now at the lobby for A16, after having gotten sick once more. I started wearing a mask once more in order to keep the sickness to myself and not to spread it around. Another Cold, もちろん. I am beginning to work on timeline for Scyrus. This has been an interesting experience as it took a while to understand how to format the timeline events and also how to show the timeline.

As I am currently sitting here I am listening to Darren learn how to count up to Ten and down from Ten. Both four and Seven change sounds when going in either direction. Which adds to the confusion.
