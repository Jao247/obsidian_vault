### Journal
#### 10:58
Well It’s been almost another week since the last journal entry… and now I currently sit in 快活 club - A manga cafe chain that appears all over Japan. Gives me a lot of options for a place to chill out. Especially between Hotel stays. Most hotels only allow for check-in after 3pm if not later on in the day.

All of my locations are now booked. Between now and my flight home. I am spending the next three nights in Himeji, then three nights in Hiroshima, and 5 nights in Osaka before I go back to Tokyo.

I still have my original suitcase which I may end up keeping for a longer period of time, I have not fully figured out what I am gonna do with it. It is something where I know it will be a nuisance if i don’t end up using it as a secondary suitcase on the way home. Depends on how much more I end up buying when I get back to tokyo. There are some things that I am gonna buy and send back immediately - that being a Katana and probably a boken (wooden training sword)
