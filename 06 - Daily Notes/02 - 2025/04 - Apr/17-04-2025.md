### Journal
#### 10:41
I sit in the lobby of A16, after yet another uneventful day, spent most of today just milling about the Hostel, Hanging out with Darren on occasion and dabbling back into code once more. Apparently codingame was something I had previously signed up for, though when that was I cannot say. However I can say that it will be helpful for me to get some C++ practice in when I can, and also get my head back in the game when it comes to programming work.

As my trip to Japan is slowly coming to it’s end, I still have a choice on whether or not to make an attempt at going to that ソープ that is south of Tokyo. The option is there for a threesome and hell, I think it could be something very very fun. Though it could also be a major disappointment with the current issues I have been having. I just need to remember that It is something that should feel good, that should be fun.

I think it is time for me to play with some more stuff in Obsidian. I think I will play with some more fonts to try and make some stuff look more like it is handwritten for the RPG notes.ka
