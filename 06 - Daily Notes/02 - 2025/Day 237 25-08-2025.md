# DAILY NOTE
Monday, August 25th, 2025

### Journal
#### 22:47
Alright, let’s do this to end out the day. So let’s talk food for the day:
- Breakfast Burrito - Still going strong.
- Honey Garlic Mac & Chicken - Still tasty - This round a decent bit spicier.
- Popcorn Chicken Potato Bowl - Eh… I could do without it.

Decided to walk after work on the way home. Did an odd figure 8 in Loughrea spent roughly 30 mins. Gained about 5-6k steps. It’s nice, but lets see if I keep going with this for the week and how that may change the calories for next week.

Also considering going back to the local gym and starting the workout there again. Will need to talk to Michael Headerman to see about getting the tag re-enabled and the cost for the rest of the year - If it is any different. Who the fuck knows.

しかし, Time to shut down and call it a day.
