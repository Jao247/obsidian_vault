##### What is an NCT?
It is an test performed on Irish vehicles that ensure the vehicle is road safe. It stands for “National Car Test”. NCTs are performed at different times depending on the age of the car. If a car is brand new the car will not be tested until four years after it is first on the road. After that the test is performed every 2 years until the car is ten years old. At which point the test is performed on a yearly basis.
