### Journal
#### 17:04
Power has been out at the house for the last 12 hours, I have spent a lot of that time in bed though. As a result my phone has been slowly losing power throughout the day. The laptop however, has been turned off and so still has a large power storage saved up.

Power is being siphoned from the laptop into my phone to allow it to charge, the alternative is to go outside and start my car so that I can charge it via the wireless charger in the car. This method will allow it to charge to a decently high level and may also allow for more of the signal to get through.

Not only has power to the house been down, power to the cell towers is also currently down and as such no one has been able to get a connection on their phones except sporadically.
