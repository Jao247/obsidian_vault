# DAILY NOTE

### Journal
#### 11:15
Well. Fuck. I think my inability to properly sleep is finally starting to catch up with my body. I sit at the desk attempting to focus and continue paying attention to the information in front of me. Information which I should be readily accepting and availing of myself to work through. However, for whatever reason I find myself closing my eyes, they stay closed briefly then I feel my body start to go limp and my eyes openâ€¦ flicking around to see if anyone noticed.

This is becoming a problem. And it's one I don't have a solution to. I don't know if this is insomnia, sleep apnea, ADHD or an overactive brain that refuses sleep. But I struggle to know whether or not my body is truly, actually, rested.
