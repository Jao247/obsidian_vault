# DAILY NOTE
Tuesday, December 10th, 2024
***
### Journal
#### 11:19
Oh boy… it's been some time since I last did a daily journal entry. Not for lack of anything interesting happening, more so just not sure what to include. However with more things now popping up, and more things I want to keep track on. I am going to start doing this again.

Today on new notes created and updated:
- [[09-12-24 1441 て-form]] - although created yesterday, I did update and include all the information today.
- [[09-12-24 1140 JP Nouns]] - Flashcards for Nouns in Japanese, some of which are being used in different notes

With mornings being more on the freezing side of things I am doing my Duolingo before I leave home. This way I can let the car thaw while I study some Japanese.

Although I have created flashcards through obsidian, I have yet to practice them. I feel as though I don't have the organisation I currently want to have for them and that I need to play around a bit more before I actually start doing them as a daily driver
