# DAILY NOTE

### Journal
#### 13:25
Finished Lunch - Today is an interesting one, new employee in the office discussion of christmas dinner and what the plans were surronding that. It would have been on 20th of December which for me is a non working friday. Meaning that I would have had to make the drive to Ennis specifically for the meal. Now it has been mentioned that the meal will be had on the Thursday before hand.

The most ridiculous sentence I have had to do on Duolingo so far:
> [!JAPANESE]
> 庭には二羽鶏がいます

Which means: “There are two chickens in the yard.” and reads: “niwa ni wa ni wa niwatori ga imasu” This sentence was definitely for the purpose of messing with the reader and causing them to misstep on what was said as part of the sentence.
