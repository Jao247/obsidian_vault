1. In a small mug/bowl add 10g of oat flour, 20g of chocolate protein powder, 5g of cocoa powder, 1/2 tsp of baking powder & 40ml of unsweetened almond milk. 
2. Mix everything together with a spoon until there is no clumps.
3. Add 1 Tsp of biscoff spread in the middle & microwave for 45 seconds - 1 minute (keep an eye on it as all microwaves have different settings but 45 seconds is the perfect time for most microwaves, if it starts to overflow stop the microwave & let it cool before pressing continue if needed)
4. Take it out the microwave & set to the side, in a separate small bowl add 1 Tsp of biscoff spread & microwave it for 30 seconds. This will be your topping.
5. Spread the melted biscoff on top of the mug cake & finish it off by adding 1 crushed biscoff biscuit on top, enjoy!
