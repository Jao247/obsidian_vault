# Method
1. Start by peeling & dicing 900g of potatoes into small cubes then add them to a bowl with 1 tsp olive oil, 1 tsp salt, 1 tsp onion powder, 1 tsp garlic powder, 1 tsp Italian herb seasoning, 1 tsp smoked paprika & mix well. 
2. Add the potatoes to a tray with baking paper & air fry at 200C/400F for 20 - 25 minutes (flip halfway) or oven bake at 200C/400F for 30 - 35 minutes (flip halfway) until crispy & golden brown. 
3. While the potatoes are cooking add 900g of diced chicken breast to a bowl with 1 tsp olive oil & the same seasonings used above for the potatoes & mix well to combine.â€¢ Cook the chicken in a pan on medium - high heat for 4-5 minutes on each side or until fully cooked through, once cooked set aside. 
4. For the creamy garlic sauce in a blender cup add 450ml fat free evaporated milk, 20g grated mozzarella cheese, 30g freshly grated parmesan cheese, 1 tsp oregano, 1 tsp garlic powder & blend until smooth with no clumps then set aside.
5. In the same pan used for the chicken (do not clean - the residue adds flavour) add 4 diced garlic cloves, 150mI chicken stock & the blended sauce mixture.
6. Stir in 90g light cream cheese, 2 tsp chicken stock powder, 1 tsp smoked paprika, continue to mix & simmer until the sauce is smooth & creamy.
7. Equally distribute the crispy potatoes & cooked chicken into 4 servings, evenly distribute the creamy garlic sauce across each serving, garnish with dried parsley (optional ) & enjoy.
