# Directions
1. To a pan on medium heat add light cooking oil spray then cook 1 diced onion until softened.
2. Add:
	- 1.5 kg extra lean beef mince
	- 1 tsp salt
	- 1 tsp onion powder
	- 1 tsp garlic powder
	- 1 tsp sage
	- 1 tsp thyme
	- 2 tsp smoked paprika
	- **Cook until the beef mince is fully browned**
3. Add 4 diced garlic cloves and 100 ml Worcestershire Sauce to the beef mince mixture followed by 350 g tomato paste, mix well until combined & set aside
4. In a bowl whisk together 14 eggs, 200g egg whites & 1 tsp salt until well combined.
5. On a low - medium heat pan melt 25 g light butter then pour in the egg mixture and cook gently, constantly stirring and folding until they are nice and fluffy.
6. Remove the eggs from the pan then warm up a tortilla for approximately 30 seconds on each side, this will prevent it from tearing when rolling.
7. Evenly distribute portions of the cooked beef mince and fluffy eggs onto the tortilla, optionally add 25 g sriracha mayonnaise and some chives.
8. Roll the tortilla tightly into a burrito then toast the rolled burrito in a hot pan until golden brown and slightly crispy on the outside. Repeat this process for the remaining burritos until you have 10 total.
9. On a pan set to low heat place approximately 20 g of low fat grated cheese, place a rolled burrito on top of the melting cheese and cook for 2 - 4 minutes until the cheese is golden brown, crispy and has stuck to the burrito.
10. Repeat the last step until all 10 burritos have a cheesy, crispy layer.
11. Let them cool before individually wrapping in foil & store in the freezer for meal prep.
