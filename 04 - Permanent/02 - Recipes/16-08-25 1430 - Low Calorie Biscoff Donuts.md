1. In a bowl add 1 egg, 40g of oat flour, 2g of baking powder, 100g of low fat greek yoghurt, 1 tsp of vanilla extract & 15g of stevia.
2. Mix everything together.
3. Pour the mixture into a non stick donut baking tray (if using a regular donut baking tray lightly grease it with cooking oil spray - the donut tray I use has 6 donut cups)
4. Bake it in the oven at 180 degrees Celsius for 15 - 17 minutes.
5. While that's baking, in a small bowl add 1 Tbsp of biscoff spread & 20ml of unsweetened almond milk then microwave it for 30 seconds.
6. Once microwaved stir & mix it together to turn it into a thick sauce.
7. When the donuts are ready take them out & let them cool for 10 minutes before taking them out the tray.
8. Once cooled, one by one coat the top each donut evenly in the biscoff spread & finish it off by sprinkling 1 serving of crushed biscoff biscuits across all the donuts & enjoy!
