# Shadow Mimicry
Working on a game project - A Metroidvania where the main character is a darkness attribute magician that uses shadows to mimic strong foes he defeated. 

This game is a WIP with "Shadow Mimicry" as a working title... Current plan is to do a 2.5D either using Unreal Engine or using Godot, though that is not decided right now. This weekend is to figure out what the plan is on Game Dev Engines
