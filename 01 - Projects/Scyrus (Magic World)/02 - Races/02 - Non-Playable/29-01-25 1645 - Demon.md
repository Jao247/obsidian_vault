# Ruling system
The ruling system of the demons follows the rule of power. There are Nine planes in the Demon world. Each ruled by their own King. Under each of these realms is a series of 7 Demon Princes. These princes are known as the Seven Deadly sins of each of their respective plane.

Among the planes the Kings and their princes all travel together to a tournament to rank the planes of hell. This does not change much when it comes to the residence of the Kings or the Princes. It does however affect the access that each plane has to the main world of Scyrus. Those who rank higher as a plane typically have an easier time getting to Scyrus.
