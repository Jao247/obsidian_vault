The child grows as their other race until their 13th year. At this point the Dragon traits again become visible and even more prominent than they were at birth. The child also gains the power to shift their form to a Dragonian, over being a half-dragon or their other parent.

Although exceedingly rare, even among the Demi-Dragons is the Demon Dragons. This child comes about from the mating of a male Demon and a Female Dragonian.
