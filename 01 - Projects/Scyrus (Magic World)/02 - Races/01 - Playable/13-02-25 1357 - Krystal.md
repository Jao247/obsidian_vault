# Description
Krystals are a synthetic race, they were first created in an accident caused by the [[29-01-25 1514 - Siconis' Fanatics|Fanatics]]. They sent a town into a separate dimensions which turns organic matter into crystal. All mortals that were alive when sent over returned as a living crystal being. They are in the shape of their races before crystallisation and retain the aspects that are emblematic of that race. 

There are “New Krystals” those who have chosen to convert their life force to Krystal. Aside from those who have made this choice, there are also the transporters, Teleporters who traverse this dimension to travel between locations. Long-lived teleporters are likely to completely turn into Krystal.

Although the make-up of the crystals is unknown, the Krystals have been seen to reduce in size due to over-use of magic. This led some to believe that the crystals from that realm are batteries for magic.
