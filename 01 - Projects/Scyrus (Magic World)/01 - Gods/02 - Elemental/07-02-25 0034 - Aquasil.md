# Description
Aquasil is a being representing the oceans. Sporting deep blue skin and a body that can bloat to different sizes. Their hair represents the colours of Coral deep in the ocean. When travelling to the surface to be among the mortals Aquasil takes a short slim figure wearing a bright and multi-coloured dress to remind her of home.

## Alternate forms
To traverse the oceans, Aquasil takes the form of different sea creatures, mostly to keep up speed and to blend in with natural Fauna.

## Alternative Travel methods
Aquasil has created an artefact that her followers use to provide her locations in different points of the world. This is the “Font of ever-flowing Water”.
