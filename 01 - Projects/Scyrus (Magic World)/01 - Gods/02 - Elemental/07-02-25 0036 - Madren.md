# Description
Mother of the plant life, Madren is a god who sees the good in all things flora. In her true form she stands short and close to the earth, bearing a dark fertile dirt color skin with some small seeds growing through the cracks. She does not have hair but she does have vines that grow from her head as a replacement.
