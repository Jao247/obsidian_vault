# Description
Bearing a stark resemblance to Terun, Magnomin is a large stone shaped like a dwarf. The only indications of the difference between Terun and Magnomin is the beads of magma that run through the cracks in his surface. That and the fiery red hair that he bears when he takes a more Dwarven form. Even in this form he maintains a look close to that of Terun. He has dark skin and dark hair, but chooses to wear colors that are similar to his mother Pyrona. Instead of seeing veins under the skin, the heat of flames can be seen.
