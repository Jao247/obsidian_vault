# Description
Aerogi the god of Air, many claim to have seen him amongst the passing clouds, but who knows… potentially he has been there observing the mortals enjoying the world he helps to breathe life into.

Aerogi is light blue skinned, slim and lankey, wearing a white outfit that turns golden in the setting sun. Sometimes Aerogi decides to visit the mortals of the world. On such occasions, they take the form of a cave elf. Long white hair and an outfit that shows the colours of the sky.
## Alternate Form
Aerogi a being of the skies sometimes attains a more cloud like shape, turning into a large avian creature with fluffy clouds surrounding their body. This allows him to move without bringing too much attention to the skies.

Though more rare in it’s occurrences, there have been times where Aerogi takes the form of a dragon, soaring the skies in their form.
