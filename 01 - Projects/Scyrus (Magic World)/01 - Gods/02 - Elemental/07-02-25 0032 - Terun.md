# Description
A representation of the power that the earth contains. Terun is a short and barrel-chested being. Though considered short by the god’s standards, he still towers over mortals. His skin is a dark earthen colour and his beard covers the front of his body.  When partaking in mortal affairs (though that is a very unusual occasion). He takes the form of a dwarf, Black hair turning grey and an outfit showing the layers of the earth

He loves to spend his time deep in caves, surrounded by large collections of rock, Especially where there is a large variety of rock types.
## Alternate Forms
Terun is known to use an alternative form that allows for easy travel under the earth, as he is not a massive fan of the sky and Aerogi’s domain. This typically means that he takes the form of a giant worm. This also allows Terun to hide in plain sight when he so wishes. Posing as large outcrops of rock on the surface near his worshippers.
