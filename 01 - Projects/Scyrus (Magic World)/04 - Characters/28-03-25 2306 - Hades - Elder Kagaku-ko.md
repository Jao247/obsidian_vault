# Description
Hades is a tiefling that lived his life in peace among the mortals, He gave in to his demon blood and learned to gain control of his demon form. Hiding it from most. Hades’ full name is unknown as his demon parent is not known, and he is very unwilling to reveal the information. Due to fully accepting his demon blood, Hades has both a demon form and a human form that he can take. Mostly he is seen as his human form.

As a Human, Hades features a short bob of hair with a streak of silver framing the left side of his face. He stands at an average height, wears a relatively plain outfit for most activities and is not normally seen carrying a weapon. Hades has often been seen wearing clothes of a neighbouring nobility. Though his preference is to wear the clothes of his old home.

Any who have seen his demon form are close to Hades or have not lived to tell the tale. Because of this there is no well known information on this form.

Although longer lived than most humans would be, Hades was well loved in his city of Amaurot. He was a leader in the city, taking a seat on the council. He received the name: “Elder Kagaku-ko”. A name that represents his seat on the council. It turns out however that fate would have him play a much darker role than just a member of the leading force of the city.
