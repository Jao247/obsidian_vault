# Goal
To bring to his home city, the wonders he discovered deep in his laboratory. Machines powered by the marvellous power of Plasmamancy.

# Description
A strange dwarf, in that Inalok did not live with his people beneath the earth or deep in a mountain range. He instead chose to live near the growing town of [[20-04-25 1905 - Atashinoa|Atashinoa]]. He was a friend of the mayor Ser Albricht Ryen. Inalok stood at a tall height of 4 foot 9 inches. He lacked a lot of the more refined muscles most would associate with a Dwarf, but he still possessed the strong intellect for inventions.

His hair was black and he stood out with blue/green eyes. He did not believe in the Dwarven traditions of long flowing beards and preferred to just sport a moustache. In public Inalok always strived to appear sophisticated to the townsfolk, wearing an impressive suit featuring a purple waistcoat and a dark pinstripe jacket. When in his laboratory he preferred to don safety equipment such as a lab coat and goggles always ready for an experiment to go awry.
