# What is a Dungeon?
Dungeons are formed from a large gathering of raw chaos energy. This energy forms into a solid chaos orb that serves as the heart of a dungeon. The closest living entity with some intelligence becomes the master of the dungeon, their life force are connected to the dungeon core.

When a dungeon core is created in a monster’s den it will take on that monster type as it’s preferred type. Excess Chaos energy will be used to create more of that monster. There are chances that a higher existence of the monster may also be created. A dungeon master will be elevated to the highest status amongst it’s brethren. It will always be the first of the local monsters to reach the next possible level.
# Usage of Dungeons
Dungeons can be used as a form of training for local adventurer’s guilds. As long as the monsters of the dungeon are relatively weak some have been turned into Farming locations.

Dungeons that have existed for a long time can have treasure formed from the lingering chaos energies of the core. Some particularly strong dungeons may feature monsters wielding the treasures created.
# How is a Dungeon destroyed
There are two main methods that will destroy a dungeon;
- Killing the Dungeon Master
	- This method will usually require that all the monsters in the dungeon are killed. This is better done in one single run at the dungeon as leaving the dungeon can result in the monsters returning. This has been used by certain towns and guilds as a method to train new adventurers and help them to grow.
- Destroying the Dungeon Core
	- This would require some stealth to be able to sneak through the enemies to get to the core.
	- This could be the objective of a single team member so that they avoid more difficult enemies.
# Dungeon Anomalies
- Fragmented Core
	- During the formation of the core, if the formation was interrupted there is a chance that the core will fracture. In the event of a fractured core, all pieces of the core must be destroyed or the dungeon master killed.
	- A more difficult variation of the Fractured Core is when a dungeon master is a lich. In this case the Lich can make use of the fractures from the core as phylactories. As long as a fracture remains the Lich will be re-formed and the dungeon remain intact.
- Planetary Cores
	- This is only something that occurs when a Dungeon has existed for at least a decade. The core will grow to a large size, and continue to attract chaos energy. The new chaos energy will start to form a smaller core. With the formation of a secondary core, a sub-master is also selected from the monsters near the cores.
	- If the dungeon continues to exist after the formation of the secondary core, a third core will begin to form.
	- This does not occur when a dungeon is regularly subjugated by a group of adventurers and used to farm resources.
- Lack of potential masters
	- There have been cases where a dungeon core will form in an empty space with a lack of potential candidates for a dungeon master. In the unlikely case that this occurs there have been stories of mortals becoming dungeon masters. 
- Core formation in a populated city
	- Although exceptionally rare, there have been times where an excessive amount of chaos energies manage to gather in a populated city. When this happens an inhabitant of the city will become the dungeon master and many of the population will become slaves to the dungeon core.
	- When a core forms in the centre of a city, it is highly likely that the dungeon core will choose to spawn un-dead creatures, Skeletons, Ghouls, Zombies, etc. Mortals who are enthralled by the core are weak of mind and spirit, they are used as a construction force by the enslaved dungeon master.
	- One case of a city turned dungeon, the master of the dungeon managed to retain his composure and intelligence even under the core’s command to control and contain the city. (See: [[29-03-25 0000 - Themis - Elder Senmou|Elder Senmou]])
