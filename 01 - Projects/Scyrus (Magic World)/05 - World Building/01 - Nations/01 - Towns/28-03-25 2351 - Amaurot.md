# Incidents
Amaurot fell. It fell to a rare event. A dungeon formed in the council chambers. Themis, Elder Senmou, Became the Dungeon Master. Elder Kagaku-ko and Elder Rakpan became his thralls, as did a large number of the population. Due to the strength of the Dungeon that Amaurot created, The core eventually split, forming two planetary cores. These cores turned Elder Kagaku-ko and Elder Rakpan into sub-masters. 

Now although the cores have gone stagnant, the Elders still live. Some have been tainted by the power that the cores bestowed upon them. Others have managed to regain their sanity and have tried to return to the world that was. Elder Rakpan roams the world in search of a glorious death. Elder Senmou searches the world and seeks to keep it in balance. Elder Kagaku-ko sits in his council seat, staring at the orb, seeing the world that was before it’s appearance, and seeks a way to return the lost souls of his people to their homes once more.
