# What makes this special?
When it comes to Japanese there are multiple different Kanji and sounds used to represent what is being counted. English is similar but when it comes to the numbers itself, the sound of the numbers can change depending on what is being counted.

In English no matter what is being counted we always follow the same pattern of: One, Two, Three, Four.

In Japanese, there is a kanji for numbers then kanji for what type of counting is being done. Depending on the consonant that starts the counting word in Japanese, will determine how it is affected by the number that prefaces it.

> [!Voiced Consonants]
> \[b] \[d] \[m] \[g] are voiced Consonants in Japanese, (I disagree with that somewhat… considering when it comes to linguistics, a voiced consonant means that the vocal chords are engaged.)


> [!Voiceless Consonants]
> \[t] \[s] \[k] \[h] are voiceless Consonants in Japanese

Here is an example on how the cahnges occur:

# Related Notes
This brings back some memories of the [[23-03-25 1039 - Rendaku|Rendaku]] that I looked at before. Where some Kanji, when part of a word containing multiple Kanji, May have the first voiceless consonant become a voiced consonant to make it easier to read.
